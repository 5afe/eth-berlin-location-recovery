Location Recovery
=================

### Problem
* Private keys are too cryptic too remember
* Mnemonics are too hard to remember
* Social recovery is not really solution
  * Either you are not sure about whether to trust.
  * Do you really put that burden on your guardians?
  * Users in the space probably prefer 12 words still
* Time lock is cool but not a recovery solution by itself
* If just a single character is wrong, the private key is wrong and recovery is not possible.

### Inspiration
* Foam.space
* Memorizing using loci
  * https://www.studygs.net/memory/memloci.htm
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci 
  * Take mental walk to memorize up to 20 objects

### Idea: Remember n locations to recover
* Locations are easier to remember
  * From personal life
  * From books
  * From video games
  * ...
* How to get from locations to private key? Coordinates
* Where to get the coordinates from? Foam
* (A time lock still makes sense at the end.)
